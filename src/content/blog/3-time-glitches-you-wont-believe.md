## The Story
You complain that this year felt long? Imagine living through the year that had 445 days! 😱 In this video, we explore the weirdest timeline glitches in history:

1️⃣ The Year of Confusion (46 BC): Julius Caesar added 3 extra months to fix the calendar, making the year 445 days long! 
2️⃣ The Great Time Skip (1752): Britain and America deleted 11 days to switch calendars. September 2nd was instantly followed by the 14th! 
3️⃣ The Monster Nian: The scary reason we use fireworks—to scare away a mythological beast in Ancient China.
