## A Bear in the Army?
In 1942, Polish soldiers found a small bear cub in Iran. They named him **Wojtek**, which means "Happy Warrior."

But Wojtek wasn't just a pet. He was officially enlisted in the **22nd Artillery Supply Company**. He had his own paybook, rank, and serial number!

## The Battle of Monte Cassino
The most famous story happened in Italy during the Battle of Monte Cassino. The fighting was intense. Soldiers were struggling to move heavy crates of artillery shells.

Suddenly, Wojtek stood up on his hind legs. He walked over to a supply truck, extended his paws, and carried a **100-pound crate of ammo** effortlessly to the front lines. He didn't drop a single one.
